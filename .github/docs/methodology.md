# Claude-Centered AI Coding Workflow Methodology

## Overview

This methodology integrates **Claude Code** as the primary AI assistant throughout your development lifecycle, optimized for Python development with modern IDEs and Git/GitHub workflows.

## üèóÔ∏è Phase 1: Project Initialization & Context Setup

### 1.1 Environment Setup
```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /path/to/your/project

# Clone awesome-claude-code templates
git clone https://github.com/username/awesome-claude-code.git ~/.claude-templates

# Run interactive setup
python ~/.claude-templates/tools/setup.py
```

### 1.2 Context Priming Strategy
**Use the `/context-prime` command to establish comprehensive project understanding:**

1. **Project Overview**: Claude reads README.md and identifies project type/purpose
2. **AI Guidelines**: Loads CLAUDE.md for project-specific instructions
3. **Repository Structure**: Maps directory structure and naming conventions
4. **Configuration Review**: Analyzes package files and build configurations
5. **Development Context**: Identifies test frameworks and CI/CD setup

### 1.3 CLAUDE.md Configuration Hierarchy
Create comprehensive context files at three levels:

#### Global Configuration (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- Python version and virtual environment preferences
- Coding style guidelines (PEP 8, Black, etc.)
- Common shell commands and utilities
- Personal development shortcuts
- Security and best practice rules

#### Project Configuration (`./CLAUDE.md`)
- Project architecture and conventions
- Database schemas and API specifications
- Testing strategies and mock data
- Deployment procedures
- Team collaboration rules
- Framework-specific patterns

#### Local Configuration (`./.claude/settings.json`)
- Project-specific permissions
- Environment variables
- Tool configurations
- MCP server settings

## üîÑ Phase 2: Development Lifecycle Integration

### 2.1 Planning & Architecture (Think First, Code Later)

**Step 1: Analysis & Planning**
Use thinking modes for complex decisions:
```
Prompt Template:
"Think hard about the architecture for [feature/task]. 
Create a detailed implementation plan in a markdown file before writing any code.
Consider: data flow, error handling, testing strategy, and integration points."
```

**Step 2: Issue Analysis**
```bash
# For GitHub issues
/analyze-issue [issue-number]

# For general task planning  
/implement-task
```

**Step 3: External Memory**
For complex features, instruct Claude to create:
- GitHub issues as working scratchpads
- Markdown planning documents
- Architecture decision records

### 2.2 Active Development Workflow

**Development Prompt Engineering Best Practices:**

1. **Specificity**: "Break this into smaller, testable components"
2. **Quality**: "Include comprehensive error handling and logging"
3. **Standards**: "Follow Python best practices: type hints, docstrings, and PEP 8"
4. **Testing**: "Write unit tests alongside the implementation"
5. **Edge Cases**: "Consider edge cases and input validation"

**Code Quality Assurance:**
```bash
# Comprehensive code quality checks
/check

# Fix all formatting and linting issues
/clean

# Advanced code analysis
/code-analysis
```

### 2.3 Testing Integration

**Test Generation Prompt Templates:**
```
"Generate comprehensive unit tests for this function using pytest:
- Test happy path scenarios
- Test edge cases and error conditions  
- Include fixtures for database/API mocking
- Ensure 90%+ code coverage
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)"
```

**Automated Testing:**
```bash
# Run tests through Claude
claude -p "Run the test suite and analyze any failures"

# Systematic bug fixing
/bug-fix [test-failure-description]
```

## üîß Phase 3: Workflow Automations

### 3.1 Git Integration Automations

**Smart Commit Workflow:**
```bash
# Standard commit with conventional format
/commit

# Fast commit for rapid iteration
/commit-fast

# Comprehensive changelog updates
/add-to-changelog
```

**Pre-commit Hook Integration:**
```bash
# .git/hooks/pre-commit
#!/bin/bash
claude -p "/clean" && claude -p "/check"
```

### 3.2 Pull Request Automation

**Multi-perspective Code Review:**
```bash
# Comprehensive PR review
/pr-review
```

**Automated PR Creation:**
```bash
# Using GitHub CLI with Claude
gh pr create --title "$(claude -p 'Generate PR title for current changes')" \
             --body "$(claude -p 'Generate detailed PR description')"
```

### 3.3 CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions with Claude:**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/claude-review.yml
name: Claude Code Review
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  claude-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Run Claude Analysis
        run: |
          claude -p "/check" > review-output.txt
          gh pr comment --body-file review-output.txt
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 4: Enhanced Tool Integration

### 4.1 IDE Integration

**Configuration for Popular IDEs:**

**Windsurf/VS Code:**
- Configure `Cmd+Esc` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Esc` (Win/Linux) for instant Claude access
- Enable automatic sharing of selection/tab context
- Set up file reference shortcuts (`Cmd+Option+K` on Mac)

**PyCharm/IntelliJ:**
- Install Claude Code plugin from marketplace
- Configure terminal integration
- Set up diff tool integration

**Diff Tool Configuration:**
```bash
# Set automatic IDE detection
claude config set diff_tool auto
```

### 4.2 Cross-Platform Optimizations

**WSL-Specific Settings:**
```bash
# ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc
export CLAUDE_EDITOR="code"  # Use Windsurf as default editor
export CLAUDE_PYTHON_PATH="/usr/bin/python3"
```

**WSL File System Integration:**
```
Prompt Template:
"When working with file paths, always use WSL conventions:
- Use /mnt/c/ for Windows drives
- Prefer Unix-style paths in scripts
- Handle line ending differences appropriately"
```

### 4.3 Python Development Enhancements

**Virtual Environment Management:**
```bash
# Automated environment setup
claude -p "Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies from requirements.txt"
```

**Package Management Prompts:**
```
"When adding new dependencies:
1. Add to requirements.txt or pyproject.toml
2. Pin versions for production dependencies
3. Use development dependencies section for testing tools
4. Document any system-level dependencies"
```

## üìã Phase 5: Advanced Prompt Engineering

### 5.1 Context Management Strategies

**Proactive Context Management:**
```bash
# Use compact at natural breakpoints
/compact  # After completing a feature or making a commit

# Clear context when switching tasks
/clear    # Start fresh for unrelated work
```

**External Memory Techniques:**
```
"Create a GitHub issue as a working scratchpad for this complex feature.
Include:
- Implementation checklist
- Design decisions and rationale  
- Testing requirements
- Deployment considerations"
```

### 5.2 Advanced Thinking Modes

**For Complex Problems:**
```
Escalating Thinking Prompts:
1. "Think about this problem" (basic analysis)
2. "Think hard about the architecture" (deeper consideration)  
3. "Think harder about edge cases and performance" (comprehensive analysis)
4. "Ultrathink about this system design" (maximum analysis depth)
```

### 5.3 Multi-Claude Workflows

**Parallel Development:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Feature development
claude  # Main implementation work

# Terminal 2: Testing and review
claude  # Focused on testing and code review

# Use Git worktrees for isolated workspaces
git worktree add ../feature-branch feature-branch
```

## üîç Phase 6: Quality Assurance & Monitoring

### 6.1 Root Cause Analysis

**Five Whys Technique:**
```bash
/five  # For systematic problem analysis
```

**Systematic Debugging:**
```
"Analyze this error systematically:
1. What is the immediate cause?
2. What conditions led to this cause?
3. What are the contributing factors?
4. How can we prevent this in the future?
5. What monitoring can we add?"
```

### 6.2 Continuous Improvement

**Performance Monitoring:**
